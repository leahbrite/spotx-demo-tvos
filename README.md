# spotx-tvos-sdk
Our tvOS SDK allows you to monetize content on Apple’s recently released tvOS. Integration is simple, only requiring a few lines of code and we’ll automatically keep you updated with the latest features so you never have to modify your integration. With the ability to play ads, fire beacons, parse VAST responses and provide error reporting, the SpotX tvOS SDK is a great way to start monetizing tvOS content.
